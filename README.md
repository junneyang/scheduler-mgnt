# scheduler-mgnt
This is scheduler man, which depends on the &lt;a href="http://mesos.apache.org/">mesos&lt;/a>(a distributed systems kernel) and &lt;a href="https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/">marathon&lt;/a>(a cluster-wide init and control system for services in cgroups or docker containers). Just start to enjoy it !
